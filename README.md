# Web Text Game

A web game that uses a div tag as the canvas, and displays text
as its sprites.

## TODO

1. Collision detection
2. Animations
3. Game loop
4. Menus, and a mode system to switch controllers (event handlers)
5. Larger text (drawn using characters)

## Development Values

1. Do not introduce abstractions until they are needed.
2. Use pure functions as much as possible.
